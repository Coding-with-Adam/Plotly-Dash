*Python Dash* is fast-paced and caters to those entirely new to dashboards. It will talk you through the necessary software, then get straight into building the dashboards themselves. 

You’ll learn the basic format of a Dash app by building a twitter analysis dashboard that maps the number of likes certain accounts gained over time. 

You’ll build up skills through three more sophisticated projects. The first is a global analysis app that compares country data in three areas: the percentage of a population using the internet, percentage of parliament seats held by women, and CO2 emissions. 

You’ll then build an investment portfolio dashboard, and an app that allows you to visualize and explore machine learning algorithms.
